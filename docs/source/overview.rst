What is the DESC data registry software?
----------------------------------------

**What is it?**

A means of keeping track of datasets: where they are, when they were
produced, what precursor datasets they depend on, etc. 

**Who is it for?**

Anyone who creates a dataset for which provenance and accessibility are
important, e.g.

- it is of general interest within the collaboration
- it is used as input to further analysis steps
- it is referenced in a paper

...and anyone who needs to find and access such a dataset.
