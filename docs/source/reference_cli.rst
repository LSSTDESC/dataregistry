.. _dregs_cli:

The ``dregs`` CLI
=================

The DESC data registry also comes with a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool,
``dregs``,  which, currently, can only be used to register datasets.

See the examples section for a demonstration of its usage.

Registering a dataset
---------------------

Users can register datasets to the DESC data registry via the terminal using:

.. autoprogram:: cli.cli:arg_register
   :prog: ``dregs register dataset``
