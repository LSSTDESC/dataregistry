    "\n",
    "### Dataset Name (Mandatory)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first required argument for the `register()` function is the dataset `name`, which in our example is `nersc_tutorial:my_first_desc_dataset`.  \n",
    "- This name is primarily for human readability and can be any valid string.  \n",
    "- However, special characters (`&*/\\?$`) and spaces **are not allowed**.  \n",
    "- The combination of `name`, `version`, `owner`, and `owner_type` must be **unique** in the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A well-chosen `name` makes it easy to retrieve the dataset for queries and updates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Version String (Mandatory)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second required parameter is the version string, which follows semantic versioning:  \n",
    "- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.0.0`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Owner and Owner Type  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset is registered under an owner, which should be an informative string.  \n",
    "- If no `owner` is specified, and no global `owner` was set when the `DataRegistry` instance was created, the default is `$USER`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are further classified by `owner_type`, which can be: `user` (default), `group`, `project` or `production`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overwriting Datasets  \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, datasets **cannot** be overwritten once registered.  \n",
    "- To allow overwriting, set `is_overwritable=True` when registering the dataset.  \n",
    "- If a dataset was previously registered with `is_overwritable=True`, it can be replaced (see *Replacing a Dataset* below).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying the Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "Registering a dataset performs two actions:  \n",
    "1. Creates an entry in the DESC data registry database with metadata.  \n",
    "2. (Optionally) Copies the dataset contents from `old_location` to the `root_dir`. This is optional because the data may already be on location (see advanced registering tutorial for these cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we registered a dummy text file, but any file or directory can be ingested (directories are copied recursively).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The data registry does not support symbolic links (symlinks) for dataset registration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Options  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any parameters not explicitly specified in `registrar.dataset.register()` revert to their default values. For a full list of available options, refer to the documentation: [Data Registry API Reference](http://lsstdesc.org/dataregistry/reference_python.html#the-dregs-class).  \n",

    "## 3) Updating a Previously Registered Dataset with a Newer Version  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a dataset already registered in the data registry, but the dataset has now been updated, registering the new version is straightforward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To update a dataset, register it again using the same dataset `name` but with a new `version`. There are two ways to update the version:  \n",
    "1. **Manually** enter a new version string.  \n",
    "2. **Automatically increment** the version using the data registry’s built-in versioning system. You can choose to bump one of the following:  \n",

    "   - `\"patch\"` (e.g., `1.0.0 → 1.0.1`)  \n",
