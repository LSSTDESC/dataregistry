    "This will register a new dataset. A few notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset name (mandatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of two mandatory arguments to the `register()` function is the dataset `name`, which in our example is `nersc_tutorial:my_desc_dataset` (note there is nothing special about the `:` here, the `name` can be any legal string). This should be any convenient, evocative name for the human. Note the combination of `name`, `version` and `version_suffix` must be unique in the database. The dataset `name` allows for an easy retrieval of the dataset for querying and updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The version string (mandatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second required parameter is the version string, in the semantic format, i.e., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. There exists also an optional ``version_suffix`` parameter, which may be used to further identify the dataset, e.g. with a value like \"rc1\" to make it clear it's only a release candidate, possibly not in its final form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Owner and Owner type\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are registered under a given `owner`. This can be any string, however it should be informative. If no `owner` is specified, and no global `owner` was set when the `DataRegistry` instance was created, `$USER` is used as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "One further level of classification is the `owner_type`, which can be one of `user`, `group`, `project` or `production`. If `owner_type` is not specified, and no global `owner_type` was set when the `DataRegistry` instance was created, `user` is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `owner_type=\"production\"` datasets can only go into the production schema, and can never be overwritten (see the \"[Production Schema](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/dataregistry/tree/main/docs/source/tutorial_notebooks/production_scheme.ipynb)\" tutorial for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overwriting datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, datasets in the data registry, once registered, are not overwritable. You can change this behavior by setting `is_overwritable=True` when registering your datasets. If `is_overwritable=True` on one of your previous datasets, you can register a new dataset with the same combination of `relative_path`, `owner` and `owner_type` as before (be warned that any previous data stored under this path will be deleted first). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that whilst the data in the shared space will be overwritten with each registration when `is_overwritable=True`, the original entries in the data registry database are never lost (a new unique entry is created each time, and the 'old' entries will obtain `True` for their `is_overwritten` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Registering a dataset does two things; it creates an entry in the DESC data registry database with the appropriate metadata, and it (optionally) copies the dataset contents to the `root_dir`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data are already at the correct relative path within the `root_dir`, then only the relative path needs to be provided, and the dataset will then be registered. However it's likely for most users the data will need to be copied from another location to the `root_dir`. That initial location may be specified using the `old_location` parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we have created a dummy text file as our dataset and ingested it into the data registry, however this can be any file or directory (directories will be recursively copied).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra options\n",
    "\n",
    "All the `Registrar.dataset.register()` parameters we do not explicitly specify revert to their default values. For a full list of these options see the documentation [here](http://lsstdesc.org/dataregistry/reference_python.html#the-dregs-class). We would advise you to be as precise as possible when creating entries within the data registry. "

    "## 3) Updating a previously registered dataset with a newer version\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a dataset that has been previously registered within the data registry, and that dataset has updates, you have three options for how to handle the new entry:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can enter it as a completely new standalone dataset with no links to the previous dataset\n",

One can update the `version` in two ways: manually entering a new version string, or having the `dataregistry` automatically \"bump\" the dataset version by selecing either \"major\", \"minor\" or \"patch\" for the version string. For example, lets register an updated version of our dataset, bumping the minor tag (i.e., bumping `1.0.0` -> `1.1.0`)."
