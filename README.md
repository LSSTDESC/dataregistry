**DREGS is currently undergoing beta testing, if you would like to use the data registry please get in touch!**

### What is DREGS?

The DESC Data REGiStry (DREGS) is a facility to store and share datasets from DESC related projects and pipelines.

The data, once registered, are transferred and stored at a central location at NERSC, which can then be later accessed and queried using the ``dataregistry`` Python package, or the DREGS CLI. 

### Documentation

The full documentation for DREGS can be found [here](http://lsstdesc.org/dataregistry).
